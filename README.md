# DOS
Old DOS programs I wrote in C++ and Assembly Language many years ago using Borland Turbo CPP 3.0 and assembler

Back in 1999 and 2000 I was interested in C++ and assembly language.
This repository contains three programs for DOS mode DOS 6.2, which was popular with Windows 3.1 before Windows 95 took over.
There are 3 seperate programs in this repository:
1. Borrow - this is a loan amortization type of program
2. Matrix - this is a simply spreadsheet
3. Swift - this is a simple text editor with automatic line wrap.
To get these programs to run in Windows 10 or Windows 11 you need to download DOSBOX, which is a free and open source DOS emulator.

These programs are not much in themselves, but the source code is included, therefore they may come in useful to programmers who are studying C++ and assembly language.
